## Defining package requirements

The `requirements.txt` file contains `pandas` (and potentially other) libraries.
`pandas` depends on `numpy` as well, but since there is already a `Lambda Layer` for 
`numpy` provided by AWS, we should make use of that in our functions instead of 
including `numpy` in this custom `pandas` layer. Thatâ€™s essentially one of the 
beauties of using `Lambda Layers`, code reuse.

## Defining the Lambda Handler

Test the lambda function locally, install required packages and
update the `requirements.txt` file accordingly. When ready, execute
the following commands:

```python
sh get_layer_packages.sh
sh zip_layer_packages.sh
```

## Adding the Lambda Layer

Add the new layer as an uploaded zip file in the Lambda portion of the AWS Console
